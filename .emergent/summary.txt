The AI engineer successfully built a pixel-perfect clone of the Chainguard image directory, evolving it from a basic frontend with mock data to a feature-rich application. Initial development focused on replicating the core UI, including hero section, image cards, search, and category filters. Subsequent iterations refined image detail pages by adding multiple tabs (Specifications, Vulnerabilities, SBOM, Versions, Provenance), implementing a right-side overview sidebar, and introducing a sliding side panel for version details. Design consistency was maintained through specific branding color (), font adjustments, and a redesigned footer. The project's scope shifted from a generic product to a free, open-source community platform, necessitating removal of pricing and addition of Docker Hub-style badges. The final major task initiated was developing a modern markdown-based documentation system.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a pixel-perfect clone of  to showcase Docker images with SBOM and security vulnerabilities. Key requirements included:
-   **Initial Build**: Frontend-only using mock data, replicating design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure.
-   **Branding**: Use brand color  across the application.
-   **Core Features**: Hero section, statistics, search, category filters, image cards (with FIPS badges), and detail pages with vulnerability counts and tabs (initially only vulnerabilities and SBOM).
-   **Image Detail Page Enhancements**:
    -   Use image names in URLs instead of IDs.
    -   Add tabs: , , , , .
    -   Refactor  and  into separate tabs as per Chainguard design.
    -   Add a right-side sidebar to the  tab for , , , and  (for FIPS images).
    -   Implement a sliding side panel on the  tab to display , ,  for a selected version.
-   **Design Refinements**: Adjust font sizes to match Chainguard's compact design and implement a modern, professional footer.
-   **Platform Scope Shift**: Transition the product to a free, open-source community platform, removing all pricing details and updating messaging.
-   **Image Badges**: Add Docker Hub-style badges (, , ) to image cards and detail pages. Initially multiple, then restricted to one per image, and Open Source renamed to Community. Position badges to the right of image names.
-   **View Modes**: Implement both grid and list views for images on the home page.
-   **Documentation**: Develop a modern documentation system supporting markdown files, including  and  sections.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>

-   **Frontend**: React, React Router DOM for routing, Shadcn UI components for modern UI, Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios for API calls.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI for API, Pydantic for data models, Motor for async MongoDB access.
-   **Development Practices**: Mock data for initial frontend development,  for backend integration planning.

<code_architecture>


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application file, defines routing using . It's the entry point for the frontend, renders the  and .
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup included a  component demonstrating a basic API call to the backend.
        -   Routing was updated from  to  to use image names.
        -   New routes for , , and  were added.
        -   The  component was restructured to properly display  and  based on routes.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralized storage for all mock data used to populate the frontend components, enabling rapid UI development without a live backend. This includes image details, vulnerabilities, SBOM data, version tags, provenance, and badge information.
    -   **Changes Made**: Constantly updated to reflect new data requirements for features like additional tabs, sidebar content, badge details (official, community, verified publisher), and to remove pricing.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders the main landing page, including the hero section, image catalog, search, and category filters.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented hero section with scrolling logos, statistics, search, and category filters.
        -   Integrated  to display images in a grid.
        -   Added functionality to switch between grid and list views for the image catalog.
        -   Removed pricing-related elements and adjusted messaging for a community-focused project.
        -   Integrated the new  component.
        -   Updated badge display logic to show only one badge, positioned to the right of the image name.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Reusable component to display individual image details in the catalog view.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Updated to display FIPS badges.
        -   Modified to display Docker Hub-style badges, initially allowing multiple, then restricted to one and renamed Open Source to Community.
        -   Adjusted badge positioning to the right of the image name.
        -   Reduced font sizes to match design guidelines.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays detailed information for a specific Docker image, including various tabs.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented tabs for , , , , .
        -   Refactored  and  into distinct tabs.
        -   Added a right-side sidebar within the  tab for , , , and  (for FIPS images).
        -   Integrated a sliding side panel within the  tab to show version-specific , , and .
        -   Adjusted font sizes.
        -   Removed pricing-related elements and updated messaging.
        -   Integrated .
        -   Updated badge display logic and positioning.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides consistent footer navigation and information across the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially a basic footer, it was completely redesigned to match Chainguard's style and modern product company standards, then simplified to align with the open-source community project focus.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Protocol file for backend integration, detailing API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation requirements, and frontend-backend integration strategy.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created after initial frontend mock-up was complete and functional.
