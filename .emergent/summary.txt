The AI engineer successfully migrated a React application to a Next.js monorepo with Turborepo, establishing enterprise-grade best practices. This involved setting up shared configurations (TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind) and a shared UI package. The existing backend was moved into the monorepo, and a new Next.js docs application was created (and later removed as per user's evolving request). Key refactoring included moving to a  directory structure, introducing constants, API client services, custom hooks, error boundaries, and providers in the web app.

Subsequently, the AI engineer focused on modernizing the FastAPI backend, implementing a clean architecture with core configurations, Pydantic schemas, MongoDB models, service layers, and API routers. The database was seeded with initial data. Extensive debugging was performed to resolve environment variable parsing issues (, ) and supervisor configuration for both frontend and backend. The frontend was then connected to this new API.

Finally, the AI engineer began a significant UI/UX redesign of the web application, drawing inspiration from  but aiming for a unique, modern open-source aesthetic. This involved updating the color scheme, global CSS, and implementing new components like , , and . The image detail page was enhanced with a tabbed interface (Tags, Overview, Vulnerabilities, SBOM, Provenance, Specifications, Comparison, Advisories). The work concluded while in the process of creating the  component.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to migrate a React application named container-directory to Next.js using Turborepo for enterprise-scale best practices. This also included removing the existing Docusaurus documentation and recreating docs within the new Next.js monorepo.
Following the successful migration of the frontend and setting up the monorepo, the user requested to develop the API project using real data, adhering to modern industry standards for API development and folder organization, along with providing detailed local development instructions.
The subsequent requirement was to refactor the web application with a unique design, inspired by , to offer an open-source Docker hub alternative with all supported features. This included redesigning the homepage, header, footer, image cards, and category filters.
The latest explicit request was to enhance the image details page, incorporating a tabbed interface (similar to Chainguard's  page) with tabs for Provenance, Specifications, Comparison, and Advisories, filling them with actual content, and updating APIs if necessary.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the new, redesigned image details page with a tabbed interface, inspired by  but with a unique UI/UX. The backend API was already extended to support new features like versions and Helm charts, and the frontend (Next.js web app) was successfully connected to this API.

The UI redesign involved creating modern components such as , , and , and updating the  and . The main  was refactored to use these new components and a new provider structure.

For the image detail page, several tab components were created: , , , , and . The  was updated to integrate these tabs.

The most recent activity involves implementing the content for the remaining tabs: Provenance, Specifications, and Comparison tabs were successfully created. The AI engineer was in the process of creating the  component when the trajectory ended. The task at hand is to complete this tab and ensure all tab content is integrated with the backend API and presented with the new design.
